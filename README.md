# My Personal Project


## What will the application do?

The application will be a soccer statistics app that allows 
easy access to **player statistics** **across seasons** and different 
measures, with **comparison tools** as well.


## Who will use it?

There are a multitude of personas that could make use of 
this product: 

- avid soccer fans needing quick reference of player stats
- commentators and professionals that may need quick reference
or comparison between players
- any young fan that may need to bring statistics to support
their argument regarding players in a discussion

  


## Why is the project of interest to me?

Just yesterday, I was amidst a heated discussion regarding 
the French striker Karim Benzema, and his status among
other great strikers of this generation. Aside from the 
extreme differences in opinion, we all had the issue of
not having easy access to statistics to support our statements,
with some sources being questioned, not accurate, or not
presenting the desired amalgamation of data to us users in 
dire need of relevant stats. As such, our discussion went 
sideways and ended in a stalemate, with no one side getting 
their points across effectively. This has been a recurring 
issue for us, and I believe a very simple solution that can 
even be built by a beginner programmer such as myself would 
help this problem immensely. I hope to create a simple, but 
effective platform with a variety of use cases, solving this
issue to the best degree possible.
